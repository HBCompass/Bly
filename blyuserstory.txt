""" The main view the user operates from. """

The navbar allows the user to do a system-wide search, logout, adjust profile settings and see notifications.

Notifications for any changes in subscribed story status. (Editors are automatically subscribed to all stories under their desk. Users are automatically subscribed to stories they are attached to. Other users can opt in to subscriptions.)

The editorial queue is displayed as the default view of the dashboard:

Slug    Byline    DueforEdit    PublishDate    Editor    Platform    Status

The table is sortable by these columns.

The user can opt into a calendar view which displays stories based on either DueforEdit or PublishDate.

Clicking on a story takes the user into the Story Page.
Clicking on Network takes the user to the editorial queue of any groups in a shared network.

	 VERSION EDIT
*-------------------*
""" The view that displays the editing field for that thread of the story. """
